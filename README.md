# Tool Calling with OpenAI-Compatible APIs

This repository demonstrates tool calling (function calling) using an OpenAI-compatible chat completion API. It is designed as a learning-focused tutorial and reference notes for understanding how LLMs can:

* Decide which tool to use
* Extract structured arguments
* Call backend TypeScript functions
* Return results in a natural language response

---

## What This Project Teaches

* How LLMs reason about tools
* How to define tools/functions for an AI model
* How to execute tool calls safely on the server
* How to send tool results back to the model
* How to build AI-powered APIs with Deno

This is not just code — it’s a mental model for tool calling.
